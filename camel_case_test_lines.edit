EXERCISES 
Exercise 11 
Youâ€™re rewriting an application that used to use YAML as a 
configuration language. Your company has now standardized on 
JSON, so you have a bunch of .yaml files that need to be turned 
into .json. Write a script that takes a directory and converts each 
.yaml file into a corresponding .json file (so database.yaml becomes 
database.json, and the contents are valid JSON). 
Exercise 12 
Your team initially chose to use camel_case names for variables, 
but then changed their collective mind and switched to 
snake_case. Write a script that scans all the source files for 
camel_case names and reports on them. 
Exercise 13 
Following on from the previous exercise, add the ability to 
change those variable names automatically in one or more files. 
Remember to keep a backup of the originals in case something 
goes horribly, horribly wrong.
